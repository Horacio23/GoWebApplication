//TODO: cast int64 into int and check query works

IDEAS:

Essentials:
-check how to use the age function from sql
-create an email field
-create a fee field
-create a transactions table with the client id, transaction date, and transaction fee (that runs every day and puts the transactions of the current date in)
-different views for each transaction
-change transaction to be a dropdown

Nice To Have:
-the template shows the clients with a certain date in a different color
-be able to sort full list of clients by date

Eventually:
-Create updates that show how many clients have changed date status (1 year or 5, etc)

Lastly:
-Be able to fill the forms out in the website.
