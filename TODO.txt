//TODO: cast int64 into int and check query works

IDEAS:

Essentials:
-creating an ajax call to get client and put it in a modal
-check how to use the age function from sql

Nice To Have:
-the template shows the clients with a certain date in a different color
-be able to sort full list of clients by date

Eventually:
-Create updates that show how many clients have changed date status (1 year or 5, etc)

Lastly:
-Be able to fill the forms out in the website.
